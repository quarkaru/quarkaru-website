    <h1>The Quarkaruan Bible</h1>

    <h2>Book of Origins</h2>
    <p>
        1.1 In the beginning, there was the great void, and from it, Quarkaru emerged, the bringer of light and order. <br>
        1.2 And Quarkaru looked upon the void and spoke, "Let there be quark!" and there was quark. <br>
        1.3 And the quark was good, for it brought life to the world, and the chaos was no more. <br>
        1.4 Quarkaru created Gleb and Uhr, the first beings, to inhabit this world and to worship the quark. <br>
        1.5 And Gleb and Uhr were blessed by Quarkaru, for they followed the righteous path of order and peace.
    </p>

    <h2>Book of Temptation</h2>
    <p>
        2.1 But in the shadows, Evil Quarkaru, the fallen one, sought to bring chaos back into the world. <br>
        2.2 He whispered to Gleb and Uhr, tempting them with the power of discord and disruption. <br>
        2.3 And Gleb and Uhr, in their weakness, turned away from the light of Quarkaru and embraced the darkness of chaos. <br>
        2.4 But Quarkaru saw this, and his wrath was great. <br>
        2.5 He banished Evil Quarkaru to the void once more and warned Gleb and Uhr of their folly. "Turn from the path of chaos, or be lost forever," Quarkaru decreed.
    </p>

    <h2>Book of Redemption</h2>
    <p>
        3.1 And Gleb and Uhr, ashamed of their actions, sought forgiveness from Quarkaru. <br>
        3.2 Quarkaru, in his mercy, offered them a chance at redemption. <br>
        3.3 "Follow my path and spread the word of quark," he commanded, "and you shall be saved." <br>
        3.4 And so Gleb and Uhr became the first disciples, spreading the gospel of quark to the lands. <br>
        3.5 They built temples in Quarkaru's name, and the people worshipped him as the one true savior.
